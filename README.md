# README

This is a graphical frontend for the Unix ``traceroute'' utility.
Written using the Processing API.

It should work under all Unix systems.

Prerequisites are:

 * ``traceroute'', ``dig''
 * Java


# Project Status?

I am going to enhance the utility to a more general way of 
visualising realtime information on the earth globe.


# GeoIP

The GeoIP lookup is done using a GeoIP database:
